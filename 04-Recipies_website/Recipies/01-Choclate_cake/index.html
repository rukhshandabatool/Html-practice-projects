            <h3> 👩‍🍳 Instructions </h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- 
                    List tags are used like unordered list to show the data when proper order doesn't needed.
                -->
                <li> 
                    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans (or one 9x13-inch pan).
                </li>
                <li> 
                    In a large bowl, sift together the dry ingredients: flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Add the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix well until smooth using a hand whisk or mixer.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Slowly pour in the boiling water while mixing. The batter will be thin — that's perfect! 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pour the batter evenly into the prepared baking pan(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake for 30-35 minutes (check at 30 mins). Insert a toothpick into the center — it should come out clean.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
                </li>
            </ul>
