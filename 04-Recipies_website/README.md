## 📖 Overview  
This is a **pure HTML-based Recipe Website** designed and developed with simplicity, clarity, and creativity.  
It showcases a collection of delicious recipes, organized for easy navigation and a pleasant browsing experience.  

In this project I learn how a fully functional and visually appealing website can be built **using only HTML**, with minor inline styling through the CSS `style` attribute.

- 🎨 **Clean Visuals** — Soft color palette and semi-transparent sections designed for a comfortable user experience.

Minor design **tweaks were made by me** in homepage visuals using **Adobe Illustrator**, including:
