# HTML Portfolio Practice Project

This is a basic portfolio layout created using only **HTML**. It was built as part of my practice to understand the structure of a web page and how different HTML elements come together to form a layout.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Clean portfolio structure
- Includes sections for introduction, skills, and contact
- Banner image used to enhance visual appearance
- Practice project with no CSS applied yet

## 💡 Purpose

To practice and demonstrate foundational HTML skills before moving on to styling with CSS. This is part of my learning journey as a beginner web developer and designer.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add CSS for styling and responsiveness
- Improve layout structure for usability
- Convert into a complete personal portfolio in the future
