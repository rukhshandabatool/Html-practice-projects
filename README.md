# HTML Practice Projects

* This repository contains beginner-friendly HTML-only projects I've built as part of my web development learning journey.
* Each folder represents a separate project, starting with pure HTML. I plan to revisit and enhance these projects with CSS and JavaScript later.

## Projects Included
