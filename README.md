# HTML Practice Projects

* This repository contains beginner-friendly HTML-only projects I've built as part of my web development learning journey.
* Each folder represents a separate project, starting with pure HTML. I plan to revisit and enhance these projects with CSS and JavaScript later.

## Projects Included

- My First Portfolio Layout (HTML only)
- Contact Form (HTML only)  ⚠️ Note: 
                                    This project uses [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/post) to test form submission.
                                    It is for practice/demo purposes only. The data is not stored or processed.
                                ⚠️ This form is for demonstration purposes only. Please do not enter real personal information.
                                    No data is stored or used — the service is only for testing form submission behavior.
