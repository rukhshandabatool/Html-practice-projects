# 🌐 HTML Practice Projects

This repository contains **beginner-friendly HTML projects** I built as part of my **web development learning journey**.  
Each folder represents a separate mini project — designed to strengthen my understanding of **HTML structure**, semantic tags, and basic styling etc.

I plan to revisit and **enhance these projects with CSS and JavaScript** later as I grow my skills.
