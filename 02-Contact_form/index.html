    <p> Fill out the following questionare for conatct purpose. </p>

    <form action="https://httpbin.org/post" method = "post"> <!-- Openning of form tag -->
    <!-- The action defines where your form gets submitted 
        I use the action="https://httpbin.org/post" → this sends your form data to a server.
        The method="POST" tells it to send the data securely.
    -->
    <!--
        I use a test service like https://httpbin.org/post to view the data after submission:
        <form action="https://httpbin.org/post" method="post">
        It will open a new page showing all submitted data. Great for testing form behavior. 
    -->
    <!--
        If you’re not using a backend (like PHP or Python), and just want to prevent errors when clicking “Submit”:
        <form action="#" method="post">
        # means “stay on this page.”
        method="post" means the data will be sent invisibly (but nothing will actually happen).
